libre mappings for the minecraft beta 1.7.3 server software. currently very incomplete.

these are effectively an adaptation of the official mojang mappings available for the latest versions of minecraft (since 1.14). by comparing implementations between both versions, a best-effort attempt is made to map the appropriate names to this old version of the minecraft server software.
